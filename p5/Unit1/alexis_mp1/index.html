    <h3> This is Terrance and he carries around a tombstone that contains the
    soul of his passed on grandma. Just by command Terrance can summon his grandmother,
    Claudia, who turns into a zombie and protects him from bad things and people.
    Kind of a take on the boy and beast trope..</h3>
